Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework for developing and deploying AI agents. While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, ADK is model-agnostic, deployment-agnostic, and is built for compatibility with other frameworks. ADK was designed to make agent development feel more like software development, to make it easier for developers to create, deploy, and orchestrate agentic architectures that range from simple tasks to complex workflows.

ADK web is the built-in dev UI that comes along with adk for easier development and debug.

## ‚ú® Prerequisite

- **Install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)**

- **Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en)**

- **Install [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/tools/cli)**

- **Clone [adk-web (this repo)](https://github.com/google/adk-web/)**

## üöÄ Running adk web

To be able to run `adk web`, follow the steps from the root of your local
adk-web folder:

### Install dependencies

```bash
sudo npm install
```

### Run adk web

```bash
npm run serve --backend=http://localhost:8000
```

## Updating the Material 3 Theme

To refresh the Material 3 design tokens/colors used by ADK Web:
1. Obtain the exported CSS bundle (containing `tokens.css`, `colors.module.css`, `typography.module.css`, `theme.css`, `theme.light.css`, and `theme.dark.css`).
2. Run `node scripts/sync-material3-theme.mjs "/absolute/path/to/css bundle"` from the repo root.
   - The script copies those files into `src/styles/material3/` and rewrites `_theme-colors.scss` with the new palette tones so Angular Material stays in sync.
3. Rebuild (`npm run build`) to verify the new palette.

Panel colors (e.g. the Configuration panel) resolve through the CSS variables defined in `src/styles.scss:261`‚Äì`src/styles.scss:272`. Those map to the Material tokens (e.g. `--md-sys-color-surface-container-high-dark`) in `src/styles/material3/tokens.css`.
